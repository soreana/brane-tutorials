|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Handling Inputs and Outputs       | Build a package that takes user input, processes it, and returns an output. Example: Factorial calculation. | Adding `input` parameters, modifying Python code for dynamic inputs, testing with various inputs. |
| Data Processing Workflow          | Create a package for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL). Example: Scraping and processing data. | Handling dependencies like `requests` or `pandas`, defining multiple tasks, structuring modular code. |
| Package with External Libraries   | Build a package using external Python libraries. Example: Generating plots with Matplotlib or Seaborn. | Specifying library dependencies in `container.yml`, including complex Python scripts, visualizing results. |
| Combining Packages with APIs      | Interact with external APIs in a package. Example: Fetching weather data and displaying forecasts. | Adding API calls, handling keys securely, parsing and using API responses.                       |
| Machine Learning Workflow         | Create a package for ML tasks like training models or making predictions. Example: Housing price predictions. | Including ML libraries like Scikit-learn, working with model files, combining ML with data processing packages. |

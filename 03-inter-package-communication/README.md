# Inter-Package Communication Tutorial: Overview

Welcome to the "Inter-Package Communication" tutorial for Brane! This tutorial demonstrates how to connect multiple packages within a Brane workflow to pass information seamlessly between them.

## Overview

In real-world applications, tasks are often modular, requiring different components to work together. This tutorial focuses on demonstrating how to:
- Create two packages that communicate via JSON data.
- Build a workflow to connect these packages.
- Enhance the workflow with additional features for smarter execution.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a deeper understanding of how to design modular workflows and integrate packages to create reusable and scalable pipelines.

## Structure of the Tutorial

This tutorial is divided into the following steps:
1. **Create Package 1**: Learn how to build a package that generates structured data.
2. **Create Package 2**: Develop a package that consumes and processes the data from Package 1.
3. **Build the Workflow**: Write a Brane workflow to connect the two packages.
4. **Enhance the Workflow** (Optional): Add logging or conditional logic for smarter execution.
5. **Test and Run the Workflow**: Run the workflow and review the results.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you:
- Have Brane installed and configured on your machine.
- Completed the [First Package Tutorial](../02-first-package/README.md) to understand the basics of package creation.

## Next Steps

To begin, proceed to [Step 1: Create Package 1](../03-inter-package-communication/README.md#step-1-create-package-1) to build the first package in this tutorial.
